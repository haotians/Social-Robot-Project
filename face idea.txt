General Idea for Deep-learning Based Face Identification System
--Haotian Shi, 2016-02-14

1. train a CNN based face recongnition network using millions of faces. 
   Data size is important for we want the network to be able to learn as much features as possible

2. for new traing samples(format modified according to the requirement of the trained network in 1), 
   i.e. new faces in our robotic system, exatrct the data in the first full connect layer or layers as features

3. reduce the dimision of features to about 200(?) though PCA process

4. use classic face classifiers(KNN or navive bayesian) to train the features and generate models

5. apply svm to the trained classifier models and get a final decision model

6. when a face is detected, go though process 2-3, then comparing results with the faces already in the database and generate a confidence scores. 
   For scores within a given threshould, consider this face already known to the robot.
   Pick the highest confidence score as the final output
