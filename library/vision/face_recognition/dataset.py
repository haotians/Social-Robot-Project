# To abstract the dirty things away, we are going to use a 
# new class, which we call a NumericDataSet. This NumericDataSet
# allows us to add images and turn them into a facerec compatible
# representation.
#
# This DataSet does not provide a method for removing entities yet,
# because this would render the ordering of the labels useless. 
# This is caused by a severe limitation of the framework right now,
# because it would make algorithms like LDA and PCA fail.
